    <h1>Miso Soup</h1>

    <img src="miso-soup-gif.gif"> 

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup that starts with a dashi stock and is flavored with miso paste. </p>
    <p>Dashi is an umami-rich stock made from dried seaweed and dried fish. Miso paste, meanwhile, is a paste made from soybeans, salt, and koji rice. </p>
    <p>  The brothy soup usually contains tofu and green onions.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>For the dashi</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 cups water </li>
        <li> 1 piece konbu (dried kelp)</li>
        <li> 1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)</li>
    </ul>  
    
    <h4>For the miso soup</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> 7 oz soft/silken tofu </li>
        <li> 4 - 5 Tbsp miso</li>
        <li> 1 Tbsp dried wakame seaweed</li>
        <li> 1 green onion/scallion</li>

    </ul> 
    
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dashi, add the water and konbu into a medium saucepan, and slowly bring to a boil on medium-low heat. Right before the stock boils, remove the konbu.</li>
        <li>Add the katsuobushi to the konbu dashi and bring it back to a boil again. Once the dashi is boiling, reduce the heat, simmer for just 30 seconds.</li>
        <li> Turn off the heat and let the katsuobushi sink to the bottom, about 10 minutes. Then, strain through a fine-mesh sieve.</li>
        <li> Add the dashi to the saucepan. If you are using premade dashi, bring it to simmer over medium heat and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add the miso (typically, use 1 Tbsp miso for every 1 cup (240 ml) of dashi). Put the miso in a ladle, slowly add the dashi into the ladle, and stir with chopsticks to dissolve the miso completely.</li>
        <li>Cut the tofu into Â½-inch (1.3 cm) cubes and add to the miso soup.</li>
        <li>Add the dried wakame seaweed. Reheat the miso soup until it is just hot. <b>NEVER BOIL</b> miso soup because it loses nutrients, flavor, and aroma. Add the chopped green onions right before serving to keep their fresh fragrance and color.</li>
        <li> Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
