    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Onigiri (おにぎり) are Japanese rice balls made of steamed rice that have been compressed into a triangular, ball, or cylinder shape and are usually wrapped in nori seaweed sheet. They can be flavored lightly with just salt or filled with a variety of fillings. </p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>For the steamed rice</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 cups uncooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
        <li> 2½ cups water </li>
      
    </ul>  
    
    <h4>For the tuna mayo onigiri</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt) </li>
        <li> 4 sheets nori (dried laver seaweed) </li>
        <li> ½ (5-ounce) can albacore tuna (preferably packed in olive oil)</li>
        <li> 2 Tbsp Japanese mayonnaise</li>
        <li> ½ Tbsp soy sauce</li>

    </ul> 
    
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h4>To prepare the steamed rice</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the rice in a large bowl and gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times.</li>
        <li>Let the rice soak in water for 30 minutes. Transfer the rice to a sieve and drain it completely for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li> Combine the rice and measured water in a heavy-bottomed pot. I recommend a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid as it is thicker at the base so it maintains and distributes heat better. Cover the pot with the lid and bring it to a boil over medium heat. </li>
        <li> Once the water is boiling, turn the heat to the lowest setting and continue to cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed. At the 12- to 13-minute mark, take a quick peek; if there is any water left, close the lid and continue cooking for another minute or so.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot (with the lid on) from the heat and let it steam for another 10 minutes. Then, remove the lid and transfer the rice to a large plate or baking sheet lined with parchment paper (I use a sushi oke). Fluff the rice with a rice paddle. Let the hot rice cool until it’s warm and you can hold the rice without burning your hands. However, do not let the rice completely cool down.</li>

    </ol>


    <h4>To prepare the tuna mayo filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the drained canned tuna in a bowl and add the Japanese mayonnaise and soy sauce. Mix to combine.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To make the onigiri</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the nori sheets into thirds.</li>
        <li>First, wet both of your hands with water to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands.</li>
        <li>Then put some salt in your hand and rub to spread it on your palms. How much salt? I dip three fingertips in kosher salt as pictured below. If you are using table salt, use half the amount as it’s saltier than kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Scoop a handful of warm rice (about ⅓ cup) into one hand. Create a small well (indentation) in the center of the rice. Put one kind of filling (about 1-2 tsp) inside. Then mold the rice with your hands around the well to cover your filling completely.</li>
        <li>Gently press the rice around the filling to form the rice into a triangle. I use three fingers (thumb, index finger, and middle finger) to make a triangle corner. Your hands should be just firm enough so the onigiri doesn't fall apart. You don't want to squeeze the rice too tightly.</li>
        <li>Wrap the onigiri with a piece of nori seaweed. If you like the crispy nori, wrap it with nori right before consuming the onigiri. Make sure to keep the nori in an airtight container or bag so it will not get stale.</li>
        <li>Place a little bit of each filling on the tip of the onigiri so you can identify which filling is inside.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
